## stockTracker.py
This script takes the list of stocks and quantities that is in a portfolio and outputs graphs of various timetables.

1) Uses Yahoo Finance API to collect current price.
2) Uses pickle to store and restore data for dynamic graphs (30-day, 90-day, 1-year).
3) Uses Matlabplot(?) to create plots.
4) Alerts user when dividend takes place (qty of stock may change and should be manually updated)
5) Pulls from multiple Portfolios (csv's?)
